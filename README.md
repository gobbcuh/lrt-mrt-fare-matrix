# **LRT - MRT FARE MATRIX ðŸš‰**

ðŸš§**On-Going Updates**

This project is undergoing continuous updates due to the **LRT-1 Extension** and improvements to create a more efficient codebase. Here's what you can expect:  

- **Enhanced Code Structure**: Transitioning to modular programming using **C functions** for easier debugging and better maintainability.  
- **Utilization of Pointers**: To optimize memory usage and improve data handling across the system.  
- **File Handling Integration**: Users will soon receive a **travel receipt** after completing trips across all train lines, ensuring a more seamless and user-friendly experience.  
- **Future Compatibility**: The code will accommodate future extensions of the train lines to adapt to new routes and fare calculations.  

Stay tuned for updates as I refine the project further! ðŸš€
