# **LRT - MRT FARE MATRIX ðŸš‰**

**ðŸš†About This Project**

The drafts in this repository are part of my journey while working on my **LRT-MRT Fare Matrix** project, which aimed to calculate fares across different train lines. This was my **final project** during the **first term of my first year** in a programming course, where I explored and applied **C language** concepts.  

**ðŸš§On-Going Updates**

This project is undergoing continuous updates due to the **LRT-1 Extension** and improvements to create a more efficient codebase. Here's what you can expect:  

- **Enhanced Code Structure**: Transitioning to modular programming using **C functions** for easier debugging and better maintainability.  
- **Utilization of Pointers**: To optimize memory usage and improve data handling across the system.  
- **File Handling Integration**: Users will soon receive a **travel receipt** after completing trips across all train lines, ensuring a more seamless and user-friendly experience.  
- **Future Compatibility**: The code will accommodate future extensions of the train lines to adapt to new routes and fare calculations.  

Stay tuned for updates as I refine the project further! ðŸš€
